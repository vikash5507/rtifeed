right of an individual to seek information in terms of section 2(j), as to the number of times he can seek particular information from public authorities.  it is, however, observed that the said right should be exercised diligently and not as means to abuse the process of law, which may defeat the purpose of rti act.<br/>\n<br/>\nin light of the above, it is the decision of the undersigned that the
